            This project is called "Spendwise". It is an android app meant to help
            with expense tracking  and budgeting for users. It allows a collaborative tool
            by allowing users to set spending goals with their friends that they are able to add. 
            It also integrates ai by allowing the user to chat with an ai chatbot
            that gives it advice, albeit not legal financial advice. It allows users
            to set budget goals, track expenses, and how that affects their budget goals.
            The chatbot can then help them decide how they can improve their expense tracking.

            Above is a DCD diagram of our project. We implement several 
            design patterns. The architecture that we follow is 
            MVVM. We have separate models, view models, and views. Views deal with
            everything that is ui related. Models represented 
            how we handled objects and other classes
            that stored data which connected to the backend. View model connected both by
            exposing live data to the view. As shown in our
            diagram, we had several models such as for example, budget, expense, firebase-repository
            class which handled backend data and objects. We had allf of our activities
            which represented pages in activities such as 
            chatbot activity, dashboard activity, etc. Our viewmodels
            such as chatbotviewmodel, dashboardviewmodel, helped with
            getting the data for display on the view pages. 
            We also used different design patterns. 
            One such pattern we implement is the observer pattern
            which notifies viewmodels when spendviewcalculator completes budget calculations. 
            We also implement the decorator pattern which is used to add features to dialog objects
            without changing their structure. This then helps us customize our popups.
