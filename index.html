            This project is called "Spendwise". It is an android app meant to help
            with expense tracking  and budgeting for users. It allows a collaborative tool
            by allowing users to set spending goals with their friends that they are able to add. 
            It also integrates ai by allowing the user to chat with an ai chatbot
            that gives it advice, albeit not legal financial advice. It allows users
            to set budget goals, track expenses, and how that affects their budget goals.
            The chatbot can then help them decide how they can improve their expense tracking.
