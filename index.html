            This project is called "Spendwise". It is an android app meant to help
            with expense tracking and budgeting for users. Users can create monthly or 
            weekly budgets that automatically roll over for their given period, add expenses
            that are directly linked to those budget categories, and recieve visual insights on their
            spending habits and how well they're sticking to their budgets via charts displayed on their
            dashboard. Users recieve notifications when they're close to their budget limits and SpendWise 
            tracks when a user has been inactive in logging expenses and prompts them to make sure they're
            staying on top of their goals. Beyond just personal savings tracking, SpendWise is a collaborative tool that 
            allows users to connect with their friends on the app to set savings goals together. 
            SpendWise also has an integrated AI financial assistant chatbot that allows users
            to recieve personalized savings advice, thorough expense reports, and detailed guidance
            on how to manage budgets that they've almost used up to get by before they reach the end of
            that period.

            Above is a DCD diagram of a portion of our project. The architecture that we follow is 
            MVVM. We have separate models, view models, and views (not displayed in the DCD above). Views deal with
            everything that is ui related. Models represented 
            how we handled the backend/business logic of our class. 
            The view models served as a connection between both by exposing live data to the view. As shown in our
            diagram, we had several models such as for example, budget, expense, firebase-repository
            class which handled backend data and objects. The activities managed the user interaction for each active screen 
            (e.g. chatbot activity, dashboard activity, etc) as well as all input forms and popups. 
            Our viewmodels, such as chatbotviewmodel and dashboardviewmodel, helped with
            getting the data to display on the view pages (e.g. fetching the updated data for the visualization
            charts on our homepage). 
            We implemented several design patterns, though not all of them are represented in the DCD above.
            In particular we showcased the singleton pattern, strategy pattern, factory pattern, observer pattern,
            and the decorator pattern. Our singleton FirebaseRepository manages our database repository in order to store
            a user's information and update it during their app session. Our strategy pattern was used to allow users to sort the
            list of displayed budgets and expenses on their respective tabs by ascending and descending date while ensuring that
            adding new sorting methods does not violate the open-closed principle, simply requiring the developer to implement our SortingMethod
            interface and add the new method as an enum option to be displayed in the dropdown for sorting methods. Our factory pattern is used
            for the creation of the charts on the user's dashboard. Both PieChart and BarChart are created with the ChartFactory which means the creator
            is not explicitly aware of what specifically it's creating.
            Our observer handles notifying the viewmodels when our SpendViewCalculator completes recomputing budget calculations.
            This allows all of our pages to update their data in real time as new budgets, expenses, and savings groups are made.
            We used the decorator pattern to add features to dialog objects without changing their structure. 
            This then helps us customize our popups, adding navigation buttons, borders, and alert sounds.
